# HEXA-robot-AI
This repository includes the code and information for the UCFAI cv-learn's robotic computer vision project

### Team Members:
- Ryan Kendrick
- Ryan Pattillo
- Ethan Frakes
- Kenley Rodriguez

### Description:
This project will be focusing on using computer vision to make a hexa-robotic device to detect objects and perform specific tasks that the UCFAI team would like the robot to complete. Our end goal is to have the robot distinguish different objects and perform desired tasks such as focus on distinct objects or avoid things that would be dangerous to the robot. The end goal of this project is to educate the team members on how to incorporate python code for robot vison into a robotic device.
